# Draft-artefacts-for-review
This repository contains draft documentation/artefacts that are under review or development. It is used to promote visibility of work in progress, and to support and encourage early engagement and collaboration with interested parties in the A-NZ Peppol community. 

Interested parties are welcome to use these materials to get detailed information on particular topics, and/or to provide early feedback and get involved in discussions.

The artefacts in this repository should not be assumed to be candidates for formal releases, as potential or planned changes to Peppol standards will be subject to Peppol change management processes.

# What's inside

## 1. Peppol International (PINT) Billing

This repository is used to share the progress of PINT development for the A-NZ community. 
### Draft PINT A-NZ specifications
The draft [PINT A-NZ specifications](https://test-docs.peppol.eu/pint/pint-aunz/) were issued for [Peppol member review](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RR/pages/3152150529/2023.09.18+PINT+A-NZ+specifications+v0.9) by OpenPeppol on 18-Sep-23, with feedback via OpenPeppol due by 10-Nov-23.

A spreadsheet cross-referencing between the current A-NZ and PINT A-NZ specifications is available [here](https://github.com/A-NZ-PEPPOL/Draft-artefacts-for-review/blob/main/PINT_A-NZ_to_current_rule_cross_reference.v0.1.xlsx). The information has been provided to assist service providers to understand the differences in the implementation of business rules, and is non-normative. In the case of any omissions or discrepancies, the published specification takes precedence.


### Next steps
The PINT A-NZ specifications will initially be available as optional specifications; however, the  Australian and New Zealand Peppol Authorities (A-NZ PAs) intend to consult with members about migrating from the existing A-NZ Invoice extension and Self-Billing specifications to the new PINT A-NZ specifications.

The migration will be formalised in the coming months and will be supported by migration plans specifying the implementation period, at the end of which the PINT A-NZ specifications will be mandated.

The A-NZ PAs will engage with SPs accredited in A-NZ to understand impacts and considerations to inform those draft migration plans.

### History
The context and background of PINT can be found at [Peppol International Invoicing Work Group - Confluence (atlassian.net)](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINT/overview). 
The Peppol PINT working group (led by OpenPeppol and consisting of Peppol Authorities, service providers and end users from Europe, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan) completed the initial draft PINT model in December 2020 (published May 2021). 

The draft PINT Billing specification and A-NZ, EU, SG and JP jurisdiction specialisations were published in June 2022 to support the proof-of-concept testing by the [PINT Reference Group](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINTPoC/pages/2431942672/PINT+PoC+Reference+Group).  

The 'base' [PINT Billing specification](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/pint/) was published in June 2023.
