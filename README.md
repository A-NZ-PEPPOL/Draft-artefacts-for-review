# What's inside

## 1. Peppol International (PINT) Billing

This repository is used to share the progress of PINT development for the A-NZ community. 

### PINT A-NZ Published
In December 2023 the new Peppol International (PINT) A-NZ Billing specification was published. The Australian and New Zealand Peppol Authorities have committed to migrating to that specification. The migration dates are confirmed, the PINT A-NZ Billing specification will become mandatory on 15 November 2024 and after 15 May 2025 the A-NZ Peppol BIS 3.0 extensions will be phased out and no longer available for use. You can view the new PINT A-NZ specifications [here](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/).

A spreadsheet cross-referencing between the current A-NZ and PINT A-NZ specifications is available [here](https://github.com/A-NZ-PEPPOL/A-NZ-PEPPOL-BIS-3.0/blob/master/Validation%20documents/Cross%20Reference%20of%20current%20rules%20to%20PINT%20A-NZ.xlsx). The information has been provided to assist service providers to understand the differences in the implementation of business rules, and is non-normative. In the case of any omissions or discrepancies, the published specification takes precedence.

### History
The context and background of PINT can be found at [Peppol International Invoicing Work Group - Confluence (atlassian.net)](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINT/overview). 
The Peppol PINT working group (led by OpenPeppol and consisting of Peppol Authorities, service providers and end users from Europe, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and Japan) completed the initial draft PINT model in December 2020 (published May 2021). 

The draft PINT Billing specification and A-NZ, EU, SG and JP jurisdiction specialisations were published in June 2022 to support the proof-of-concept testing by the [PINT Reference Group](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINTPoC/pages/2431942672/PINT+PoC+Reference+Group).  

The 'base' [PINT Billing specification](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/pint/) was published in June 2023.
