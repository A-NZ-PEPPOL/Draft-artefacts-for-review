# What's inside (in development)

## 1. Draft guidance for Invoice Routing

This draft guidance document is about how an invoice should be ‘routed’ to the appropriate destination, e.g. where a receiving organisation (i.e. corner 4) have multiple ‘business units’ or systems that processes, approves and pays invoices.

In the context of Peppol, there are two broad options:
1.	Using a separate Participant Identifier for each receiving application

2.	Using a single Participant Identifier to receive all inbound invoices, and route invoices internally (i.e. corner 4) to the correct application. 

Alternatively a combination of both options may be an optimal solution for some businesses.  

We would like to hear your thoughts, experiences or comments.  

## 2. Peppol International Invoicing Model

This document describes the semantic data model, which defines a set of business terms for invoices, that can be used in an international context. 
It is developed by the Peppol PINT working group in 2020 and this version is the final draft.  More information can be found at: https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINT/overview. 

If you are interested in PINT, you are welcome to use this document and/or provide feedback. 


## 3. PINT A-NZ Invoice Data Model

This spreadsheet is a working draft including the PINT data model and business rules.   It highlights the differences to BIS Billing 3.0 and the A-NZ BIS extension.
Refer to notes in column I for context / justifications for additional elements the PINT model (a super set) has incorporated. 

The A-NZ Peppol Authorities will provide formal updates and communications for PINT. However, interested parties are welcome to check on its progresses and/or use it as supporting documentation for internal analysis.
